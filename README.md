# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the **Movie Recommendation System**, a web application that recommends movies using advanced content-based filtering. This project combines IMDb and Kaggle movie datasets and uses modern tools like **FastAPI**, **FAISS**, and CSS(**Tailwind CSS**) to deliver fast, accurate, and elegant movie recommendations.

---

## 📌 Overview

This system helps users discover movies based on:
- Specific **movie titles**
- Preferred **genres**
- Minimum **rating thresholds**

The recommendations are generated by analyzing textual similarities in movie metadata such as titles, genres, descriptions, directors, and stars using **TF-IDF vectorization** and **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)** for fast similarity search.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 **Search** by title
- 🎯 **Filter** by title, genre, and rating
- ⚡ **Fast content-based recommendations** using FAISS
- 🧠 Combines **IMDb** and **Kaggle** datasets
- 🎨 Sleek and responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- 📊 Uses TF-IDF to analyze movie metadata
- 🧩 Fallback logic ensures results even with missing data

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

| Layer       | Tools Used                        |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Backend     | Python, FastAPI, FAISS, Pandas    |
| Frontend    | HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript(Vanilla JS )   |
| ML/Vector   | Scikit-learn (TF-IDF), FAISS      |
| Deployment  | Uvicorn (local)                   |

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Loads and merges data from IMDb and Kaggle movie datasets.
2. Prepares a `content` field combining title, genre, director, stars, and description.
3. TF-IDF vectorizer transforms text data into numerical vectors.
4. FAISS builds an index from these vectors for high-speed similarity search.
5. When a title is queried, FAISS finds the top similar entries from the dataset.
6. Filter options for genre and rating allow refining the results further.
